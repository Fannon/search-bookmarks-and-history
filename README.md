# search-bookmarks-and-history
Chrome Extension to fuzzy search bookmarks and history.

The extension can only be installed locally right now:

* Go to chrome://extensions/ 
  * Load unpacked

> This extension is WIP and only for private use first.
> It is rather configurable, but you need to change the options in `popup/popup.js`

## Ideas and To Dos
* Make extension configurable via UI
* Dark Theme
* Allow to quick edit bookmark?
