# Search Tabs, Bookmarks and History

Browser extension to search and navigate browser tabs, local bookmarks and history.

It is available for [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) browsers.
Bookmarks can be edited and tagged, with autocompletions.
It works fully offline (except the optional storing / syncing of user-settings), so there is no external communication on what is indexed and searched.

## Features

* Search for open browser tabs, bookmark folder names and tags and browsing history.
* Edit and tag bookmarks with autocompletion for tags.
* Dark mode / light mode (via system settings / [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme))
* Can be customized via user options.
* Lightweight: Written in vanilla JS with the goal to only include the minimun necessary libraries (see [credits](#credits)).

## User Documentation

* This extension can (and should!) be triggered via keyboard shortcut.
  * The default is `CTRL` + `Shift` + `.`, but you can customize this.
* Just type in your search query and it will fuzzy search through everything.
* In case you want to be more selective -> use a search mode:
  * If you start your query with `. `: only tabs will be searched.
  * If you start your query with `+ `: only history will be searched.
  * If you start your query with `- `: only bookmarks will be searched.
* This extension works best if you avoid:
  * using `#` in bookmark titles that do not indicate a tag.
  * using `~` in bookmark folder names.
* [Fuse.js Extended Search](https://fusejs.io/examples.html#extended-search) operators can be used.

## User Configuration

Currently the user options can only be written in [JSON format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). They do not need to be complete, as they just overwrite the default options.

To see what configurations are available and what they do, please have a look at the `defaultOptions` in [popup/src/options.js](popup/src/options.js).

If you want to customize some options, it is recommended to *only* add the actually adjusted options to your user config.

An exemplary user-config can look like the following example:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "visitCounter": false
  },
  "search": {},
  "tabs": {},
  "bookmarks": {},
  "history": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```
